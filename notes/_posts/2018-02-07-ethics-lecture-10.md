topic: Confucius on Contextual Duties

### Duties
- What motivates them or makes them "stick"?
  - Family (children, spouse, parents):
    - Invested into relationship
    - Instinct to take care of
    - Societal norms/laws (psychological egoist)
    - Commitment/voluntary
    - Parents:
      - Spent time/resources on us (we owe them)
      - Needs have to be met (dependents)
  - Professional duties/job:
    - Engineers:
      - Actions/work affect others
    - Military/Police:
      - Duty to protect/serve
    - Doctors:
      - "Do no harm"
  - Religious duties:
    - Identity/faith
  - Civic duties/society:
    - Owe to society?
      - Reflexive duty - to citizen too
      - Self-interest - make a better society for me

#### Thought Experiment
1. Someone is starving in NY + Jones is doing nothing about it
2. Jones' mother is starving in NY + he's doing nothing

Which is worse?

|1 or same obligation                  |2                    |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
|impartial, 1 person is still suffering|More of an obligation|
|issues w/ equal obligation            |If everyone takes care of family, nearly everyone gets taken care of|
|places moral obligation too high      |Owe her more than a stranger|

For Confucius, a person is always a person in relationship/context

> ren is biological human

> Ren is humanity as acheivement

good person = excels at his/her relationships

Filiality (duties to family) - the root of ren
- Being filial:
  - Respect:
    - convey respect
    - feel respect
    - not just providing
