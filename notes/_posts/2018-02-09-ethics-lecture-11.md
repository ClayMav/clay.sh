Kant wants to show that abstract reason is the only grounding for morality (morality formula)

### Categorical Imperative (Universal moral law)
- Formula #1 - Universal Law
  - Never commit an action that you couldn't at the same time will into universal law
- Testing: is it logical/ immoral - logical contradiction
- Can't lie: leads to a contradiction, if willed universally no one would take lie for truth
- Rational Constant: its irrational not to take context into consideration
  - better idea? - goal trying to be achieved? duties conflict?
