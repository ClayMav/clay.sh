### Important bases
- Decimal (base 10)
  - [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
- Binary (base 2)
  - [0,1]
- Octal (base 8)
  - [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
- Hexadecimal (base 16)
  - [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f]

Binary and hexadecimal is extremely important, tests and finals will test this

x92 is:
- 1001\|0010 in binary

xAC is:
- 1100\|1010 in binary

101101 is:
- also known as 0010\|1101
- xD2 in hex

1110111 is:
- also known as 0111\|0111
- x77 in hex

xA2 is:
- 1010\|0010 in binary
- 2+32+128 = 162 in decimal

xD5 is:
- 1101\|0101 in binary
- 1+4+16+64+128 = 213 in decimal

74 is:
- 0100\|1010 in binary
- x4A in hex

82 is:
- 0101\|0010 in binary
- x52 in hex

LSB: Least Significant Bit
- right-most bit

MSB: Most Significant Bit
- higher-order bit
- left-most bit

bit: binary digit (b)

Byte: 8-bits (B)

nibble: 4-bits

high nibble left most 4 bits

low nibble right most 4 bits
