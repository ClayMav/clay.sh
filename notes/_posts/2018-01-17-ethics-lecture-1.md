# Business Ethics
### What is "ethics"?
Word association:
- Right/Wrong actions
- Morals
- Cultural/Personal differences

### When we hear it
- Ethical violations

Narrow scope
- permissible/impermissible
  - "do not lie" and maximizing consequences
- what makes something impermissible, permissible

Broader scope
- What contributes to a "life well lived"
- What it means to be happy + successful

### Why study ethics?
1.  To better understand your own moral viewpoint
  - Reasons matter - could impact moral motivation
    - Lost wallet case:
      - Mencius - return it out of sympathy for owner
      - Kant - return it out of duty to the moral law
      - Laszi - return it to retain innocence (maybe leave it on the sidewalk)
2.  To be better able to interact with people in differing viewpoints
  - Recognizing that people do have reasons for what they believe, studying ethics can facilitate a dialog and resolve conflict (where possible)
    - Note: Doesn't mean sacrificing your own considered viewpoint
3.  See practical applications to other fields of study
    - Apple:
      * Decryption/ give to government
      * Customer - privacy protected
      * Rights of company
    - Automation:
      * Workers rights
    - Environmental impact:
      * Restrained at all
