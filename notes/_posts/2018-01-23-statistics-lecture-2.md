### Stem-and-Leaf Displays
- For numerical data (not categories)
- Original data can be recovered
- Instructions:
  1. Select one or more leading digits for the stem values (5-20 stems is recommended)
  2. Remaining digits are the leaves
  3. List the possible stem values (in decreasing order) in a vertical column
  4. Draw a vertical lie to the the right
- Data received from Stem-and-Leaf:
  - Typical or representative Value
  - Spread about the typical value
  - Gaps
  - Symmetry
    - symmetric
    - bimodal
    - right (positively) skewed
    - left (negatively) skewed
  - Number of locations or peaks
  - Presence of outlying data

### Dotplots
- Good for small data sets or when there are few distinct values (lots of repeats)
- Better to use histograms for larger data sets

### Histograms
A bar plot
- Each data value can be:
  - Numerical or Quantitative
  - Categorial or Qualitative
