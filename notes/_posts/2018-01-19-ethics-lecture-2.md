topic: Introducing Moral Theory

## What is Moral Theory?
- Deals with weighing out moral values

  Values:
  - Consequences
  - Principles
  - Right
  - Virtues (e.g. courage)
  - Self-interest

  We like all of these values but can we have them all? Is there a primary value?

  Should there be any limits to how much you should value these?
