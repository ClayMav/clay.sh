title: Go Lecture 1
course: Contemporary Programming Languages - CS2001
topic: Go - Basics, Variables, and Types
---

### Launch
- Started in 2009
- Bunch of Googlers worked on it.

### Go Facts
- Go is used by Google
- Maintained by Google
- Open Source - GPT
- Go's compiler is written in Go

## Go is picky
- If its worth a warning its worth an error
  - Unused Variables
  - Unused imports
  - Some "style violations"
    ```go
    if stuff
    {
      // This is an error
    }
    ```

## Idioms in Go
- Common patterns that Go developers recognize
- Examples
  - Getters don't need to start with Get
  - Don't insert superflous semicolons
  - Use a switch statement over a long if-else chain
  - The "comma ok" idiom
- Idiomatic go code uses common patterns to solve problems

## Style in Go
- No flexibility at all
- Examples:
  - Tabs not spaces...
  - Curly braces on same line...
- gofmt will fix style

## Benefits
- Easy to read
- Easy to write
- Garbage collected
- Concurrent programming features

# Hello World
```go
package main
import(
  "fmt"
)
function main(){
  fmt.Println("hello world")
}
```

## More Go facts
- Go is compiled
  - You can run small programs with `go run`
  - `go build` will allow you to build larger projects.
  - `go install` will fully install the project
  - The Go compiler has a bunch of commands:
    - `go fmt` - format your code
    - `go doc` - displays package documentation
- Go is statically typed
```go
int x = 0
// x is always an int
```
- Comment lines with `//` and `/* */`
- fmt.Println() is one way to write to stdout
  - has to be imported

### Variables
- You can declare variables many ways:
  - `var x int`
  - `var x, y, z int`
  - `var x, y, z int = 1, 2, 3`
  - Implicit types:
    - `x := 10 //int`
    - `x, y, z := 1, 2, 3`
    - `a, b, c := "a", 10, false`

  ### Types
  - Go is statically typed
  - You can specify types ahead of time
  - Sometimes, Go can figure it out
  - Built-in types:
    - Boolean type
      - **bool**
        - Predeclared constants: true, false
    - Numeric types
      - **unsigned integer** types
        - uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
          - uint is either 32 bits or 64 bits based on compiler implementation
      - **signed integer** types
        - int, int8, int16, int32, int64
          - int is either 32 bits or 64 bits based on compiler implementiation
      - IEEE-754 **floating point** types
        - float32, float64
          - float64 is default
      - **Complex number** types
        - complex64, complex128
          - complex128 is default
      - **Byte**
        - byte is an alias for uint8
          - not converted to/from uint8 automatically
      - **Rune**
        - rune is an alias for uint32
          - No automatic conversion
        - Represents a Unicode code point (like a char)
    - String type
      - **string**
        - Possibly empty sequence of bytes
        - Immutable
        - You can check length with `len(<string>)`
    - Array type
      - `[<const number of elements>]<element type>`
      - Indexed starting at 0
      - Check length with `len(<array>)`
    - Slice
      - `[]<element type>`
      - "... a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an underlying array..."
      - Backed by an array of some given capacity
      - Also indexed at 0
      - You can check length with `len(<slice>)`
      - Capacity can be checked with `cap(<slice>)`
      - Basically functions like an arraylist
      - ***PRIME TEST MATERIAL***
    - Absence of value
      - **nil**

      ### Examples
      Number types
      ```go
      i := 42 // int
      j := 50.5 // float64
      k := 0.5 + 10i //complex128
      
      var i int64 = 42 // int64
      ```
      Array
      ```go
      var myArray [10]int
      myArray[1] = 1
      fmt.Println(myArray) // [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
      ```
      Slice
      ```go
      mySlice := []int {10, 12, 14, 16}
      len(mySlice) // 4
      fmt.Println(mySlice) // [10, 12, 14, 16]

      myotherSlice := []int {}
      var mythirdSlice []int // fundamentally different, doesn't create backing array
      ```

## Foreshadowing
- Variable-related topic
  - Pointers
  - Memory allocation
- More types
  - Struct type
  - Map type
  - Channels - Used in communication
  - Interface types
- Miscellaneous items
  - Uninitialised variables are given a zero-value by default
    - 0 for numeric types
    - false for boolean type
    - ""(empty) for string
- The compiler will enforce proper use of types
```go
x := 12 // int
x = 10 // Fine
x = "frog" // NOPE
x = 12.5 // NOPE
```
- The compiler will not implicitly convert types. You have to do it yourself.
```go
i := 42
y := 5.5
fmt.Println(i+y) // NOPE
fmt.Println(float64(i)+y) // Fine
```
- The blank identifier ( _ ) is used for ignoring unwanted values
```go
x, _ := functhatreturnstwoitems()
```
