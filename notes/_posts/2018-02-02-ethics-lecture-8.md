**Principle of Utility**: Actions are good that promote utility (pleasure/pain) and bad if they do inverse

|Act Utilitarian|Rule Utilitarian|
|---------------|----------------|
|Consequences figured out for each action|Don't need to "reinvent the wheel" in terms of morality|
|Shouldn't assume at the outset some actions preferred/off-limits (beyond utility)|Use time-tested "rules of thumb": "do not kill", "do not steal" (promote utility)|
|Bentham-like calculus|Mill-like-rights|

**Case #1**: Hermit in the woods
> Rich hermit/ 1000 villagers on the verge of death

What should be done?

|Act                                |Rule                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Murder - Last resort               |Barter with him - try to appeal to him|
|Steal - if we don't, 1000 could die|"do not kill", "do not steal"         |
|Incapacitate him                   |Corrosive effect on society           |

**Case #2**: Voting

Should I vote?

|Act                                              |Rule           |
|-----------------------------------------        |------ --------|
|Is it worth the time? (Pre-decided voting states)|Civic duty     |
||Societies that have higher voter turnout usually function better|
||Mandatory voting                                                |
||Other obstacles, work etc.                                      |

#### Quality vs Quantity
Bentham:

1. Just maximize utility (whatever peoples preferences are)

Mill:

1. Thinks we actually prefer higher vs lower (we're rational)
2. Societies are happier that encourage higher over lower

Sandel's Test - higher/lower

- What do we prefer?
- Which is higher?
