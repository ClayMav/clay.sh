## What is Digital Logic
Digital data: discrete, non-continuous values

Logic: study of mathematical reasoning

## Digital vs. Analog
Signal: physical phenomenon

Analog signal: continuous signal with infinite set of possible values

Digital signal: discrete signal with finite set of possible values

Digital signals are represented by two values
- on/off, 0/1

Bit: single value

Benefits of binary:
- Ease of operation - simplicity
- Transistors operate on two-value logic
