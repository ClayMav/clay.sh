|**virtue theory**|**deontology**|**utilitarianism**|

### Utilitarianism
##### Why consequences?
1. Consequences can be studied empirically
  - People have preferences, we can study them, we can maximize
2. Rational - When there is a diff. in treatment - there is some rational justification
  - Moral community -> sentient = equal consideration
  - There is strength in the fact that they broaden the moral community
3. User friendly - easy to apply - Benthan's moral calculator

#### Anything lacking?
- how easy to figure out
- any conflict in interests... egoism, impartially?
- Rights: Sandel's organ harvesting case
